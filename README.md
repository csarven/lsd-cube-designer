# Linked Statistical Data (LSD) Cube Designer
The goal of this project is to provide a Web user-interface for researchers to design their own statistical data cubes. The statistical objects that are part of the cube model are derived from and refer to Linked Statistical Dataspaces. This LSD Cube Designer aims to lower the barrier for searching and reusing existing linked statistical components.

There is a live instance of this tooling at [http://stats.270a.info/cube-designer](http://stats.270a.info/cube-designer)

## Documentation
In progress. An URL will be provided here.


## Workflow
1. Researcher has a cube model in their mind for a study or dataset.
2. Researcher searches for concepts that are used in dimensions, measures, and attributes in statistical Linked Dataspaces e.g., [270a.info](http://270a.info/).
3. Researcher selects suitable dimensions, measures, and attributes for their data structure and components.
4. Researcher exports the structural information (e.g., in RDF Turtle format)
5. Researcher goes to lunch.
